PRIVACY POLICY
==============

ChromeLL stores some data locally in order to function correctly. This primarily includes your configuration
settings, and any data you've personally provided to the extension (such as blocked user lists, user notes, etc).

ChromeLL also scrapes some user data from the End of the Internet - this is used strictly within the extension 
in order to provide certain features. The "Highlight Topic Creator" feature requires the extension to store 
a list of topic creators from recently visited topics. The "Image Map Cache" feature requires the extension
to store image data from your Image Map page. ChromeLL also stores your username, bookmarked tags, and the
list of mod/admin tags from your profile page.

ChromeLL does not transmit any of this data outside of your browser, and does not access any of your data 
from other websites.
